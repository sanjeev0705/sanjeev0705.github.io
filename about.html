		<h1>My Bio</h1>
		<div class="tab1">
			<p>I grew up in the village called Kirne in Dolakha district. I have older brother and two older sisters. When I was little, sports was my biggest interest but as I become a teenager then technology became my number one interest. We had computer classes in grade school from 4th class and up. Even though I enjoyed computer games I was more interested in programming than playing. In high school I began learing HTML and C+ programming language. By the time I finished high school I knew I wanted to be working in programming and software developing. Fortunately I was accepted into Nami college bachelor program in computing.

		<h1>My Aspiration</h1>
		<div class="tab2">
			I aspire to more than being a software developer. I also want to have my own software company. I believe that technology can benefit the people enormously so my goal is to help others with technology as well as provide the income I need.
