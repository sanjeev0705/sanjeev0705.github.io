		<h3> How I chose  </h3>
		<p>
			My choices for developing this website including colors, images, content and style were made with input from my co-worker. We used several methods of working together such as discussion, sampling and suggestion from both of us. After placing the Nepali flag gif on my header, I began creating the navigation bar. I did this on my own and afterward I asked my co-worker’s opinion. Then we both add images for background. After considering several images I choose the photo that my brother took of Tilicho lake. I choose it not because it was my brother’s photo but it look best on my web page. I chose the colors for the web page from background photo, blue, white, black and red was added.
            Page by page I created the layout and added the content. Afterward my co-worker and I discussed each layout and I made changes as we tried out different ideas. After all the content was added we went back and tried different fonts and size of fonts. I chose Sans-Serif as default font ( it’s easy to read with a modern clean look ). The alternative font for those browser that do not support the default I chose Helvetica and Arial (these are two of the most widely used fonts on the internet). I chose font colors black and white to place on their opposite color background i.e. white text on black background and vice versa.

		<h3>My Experience Learning  </h3>
		<p>
			My experience of learning web development of this first term was great because I improved my existing skills gained new ones. The practices using HTML and CSS was beneficial (practice makes perfect). Creating web page layout is a new skill I acquired from this term. In particular, choosing and changing colors, adjusting font size and style, using flex box to arrange the content easily on each page. I learned Media Queries; which helps to define completely different styles for different browser sizes. Additionally I learned Responsive Web Design; which makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). Another skill I gained was Google Material Design. I also learned the importance and methods of making web page user friendly. Working in team taught me to communicate clearly, to listen to others ideas and how to choose the best option together with others. Pride and emotions can interfere with good team work. It does help when team workers have compatible personality. Team work also taught me the importance of clearly defining each person responsibilities. Team work definitely helped me think outside the box and be open to others ideas. Without this, something will left undone other things will be done twice. I also learned methods of research including how to find reliable sources.

		<h3>Reflection on the Project</h3>
		<p>
			In the beginning, I thought the project would be easy. To me nothing seemed to be extremely difficult parts in project . As I began working on project I realized it was harder than I expected. As I began coding I became anxious. Whenever I made changes the results were not what I wanted. By trail and error my ability to make the changes I wanted, improved. As this happened my anxious feelings went away. As I did more layout and design my confidence increased. What I enjoyed most in the project was designing and  layout part. I like being creative, I use no templates but created each page from scratch. I gained the real appreciation for how the Internet works. The world wide web infrastructure is more than amazing. Its relevance is that we can do so many things on the web in our everyday lives.
			By the conclusion of project I was feeling very positive about programming abilities. I was proud of the website I created and new skills I gained.
